            <p>Since the Investment-Based Residency program began in 2010, approximately 20,000 applications have

          <h3>1. Real Estate Investment</h3>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Minimum investment 250,000 + 1.5% deed fee (3750) + 12,500 state fee + 2625 fee tax 
            + 15,000 consulting = Toplam 280.750 Euro</p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Real estate prices in Latvia are quite affordable compared to other EU countries, 
            and as of 2025, they are even cheaper than in our own country. This is our most recommended type of investment.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Under the program, you can only purchase real estate from a company paying taxes in Latvia,
            from Latvian citizens, or from a foreigner living in Latvia (an EU citizen or someone with
            a long-term residence permit). Payment for the property must be made via bank transfer, the
            purchase price must be at least 250,000 Euros, and the property’s registered cadastral
            value must be at least 80,000 Euros. Agricultural and forest land are excluded from the
            program, but plots where a house or apartment can be built are included.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            We strongly recommend real estate investment because the property you purchase can appreciate 
            in value every year, and you can earn rental income on top of that. Our expert team closely 
            follows the Riga real estate market and can offer you many options to help you choose the right property.
            </p>
          <h3>2. Company Investment</h3>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Minimum investment 50,000 + 10,000 state fee + 15,000 consulting = Total 75,000</p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>   
            This tracks allows investors to invest in a company registered in Latvia. It’s the cheapest but not highly 
            recommended. There are two ways to invest in a company: <br/>
            <strong>50,000 Euros</strong>: Companies with a maximum of 50 employees and annual 
            turnover under 10 million Euros <br/>
            <strong>100,000 Euros</strong>: Other companies
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Although a company investment is cheaper, your investment is unlikely to appreciate or 
            generate monthly or yearly profits in practice. Also, if you ever want to sell the 
            shares you acquired, you might have to sell at a much lower price—or possibly 
            zero if no buyer is found. Moreover, if the company whose shares you purchased goes 
            bankrupt, your residence card will be canceled. In short, the funds allocated for a 
            company investment essentially only grant you a residence card. Keep in mind that there 
            may be no return or profit on your investment.</p>
            <p>A maximum of 10 foreign nationals can apply for a residence permit in the same company.</p>
          <h3>3. Zero-Interest Government Bond</h3>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Minimum investment 250,000 + 38,000 state fee + 15,000 consulting (inc. taxes and fees) = Total 308,000</p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/> 
            This application track is currently not available because Latvian authorities stopped opening bank 
            account to foreigners after the start of Ukraine war. The only open tracks now are Real Estate
            and Company investment.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Investing in zero-interest government bonds allows you to obtain a residence permit. 
            Compared to real estate and company investments, this can be seen as an easier option 
            than company investments and more secure than a bank deposit.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            While these government bonds do not pay interest, you can profit from the difference 
            between the purchase price and the nominal price at the end of the bond’s term. 
            <br> <br>
            <u>For example:</u> <br/> 
            Purchase price: 900 <br/>
            Nominal price: 1000 <br/>
            Profit: 100 <br/> <br/>
            The customer buys the bond at the purchase price, and at the end of the bond’s term, 
            the government repurchases it at the nominal price. The profit from the difference 
            between the nominal price and the purchase price is generally slightly higher than 
            what you would earn from bank deposit interest. 
            </p>   
          <h3>4. Bank Deposit</h3>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            Minimum investment 280,000 + 25,000 state fee + 15,000 consulting fee (inc. taxes and fees) = Total 320,000</p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/> 
            This application track is currently not available because Latvian authorities stopped 
            opening bank account to foreigners after the start of Ukraine war. The only open tracks 
            now are Real Estate and Company investment.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            A bank deposit is a very secure type of investment, and you can earn up to 8% 
            annual interest. That means you could get 390,000 Euros back after 5 years on 
            your 280,000-Euro investment.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/svg_star.svg' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  
            You must deposit at least 280,000 Euros into a Latvian bank. Your deposit 
            will be recorded in the bank’s system as a “subordinate liability,” which means 
            that if the bank goes bankrupt, the primary claim holders will be paid before 
            you. Since the likelihood of the bank going bankrupt is considered low, this 
            detail may not be particularly significant.</p>  
          <h2>Required Documents</h2>

                If your family members are included in the application, each family member pays 
                an additional fee. (Note that application fees differ from state fees; state fees 
                are paid after the application is approved.)</li>
              <li>Documents specific to the type of investment: Deed for property ownership, proof of 
                government bond purchase, proof of bank deposit, commercial register documents for

                other investments, the applicant and spouse each need 740 Euros, and each child 222 Euros.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p><strong>First Month</strong>: Initial communication with the client, selection of the investment, 
          payment of consulting fee, and preparation of documents for visa and residence permit applications.</p>
          <p><strong>Second Month</strong>: The client arrives in Latvia. Depending on the type of investment, 
          visits and meetings take place. All application procedures and documents are signed, 
          the investment amount is transferred to the relevant accounts, and the application 
          file is submitted to PMLP (Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs).</p>
          <p><strong>Fourth Month</strong>: The PMLP review process can take 5 days if a fee of 
          about 450 Euros is paid, or around 50 days otherwise. Generally, applications are 
          processed within about 30 days. Once approved, the state fees for the investment are 
          transferred to the relevant accounts. The client then returns to Latvia and, with our 
          best wishes, receives the residence card in person.</p>
          <p>The process takes minimum 4 months. Some applications might take around 10 months if applicant
            has any connection or travel history to Russia.
