          <h3>Limited Liability Company (Sabiedrība ar ierobežotu atbildību SIA)</h3>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  A Limited Liability Company is 
              popular in Latvia and easy to establish.
              Limited Liability Companies are divided into two categories: Standard capital (minimum 2800 Euro) and 
              small capital (between 1 and 2799 Euro).
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  Standard-capital Limited 
              companies can be established by one or more individuals or legal entities.
              Small-capital Limited companies can be established by a maximum of 5 individuals who do not hold shares 
              in another small-capital Limited company. For those wishing to obtain a residence permit in the future, 
              a standard-capital Limited company must be established.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  Once the Limited Company 
              is established, the founders become shareholders. There is no requirement to be a Latvian citizen or resident 
              to be a founder/shareholder. The chosen name for the Limited Company must not be identical to any other existing 
              company name or trademark in Latvia. The founders appoint at least one member to the company's board of directors. 
              It is not required to be a Latvian citizen or resident to serve as a board member.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  As soon as the Limited Company is 
              registered in the Commercial Register, it also becomes a taxpayer. A VAT number for the Limited Company 
              can be obtained upon the request of our client.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  You may visit Latvia to 
              oversee the company formation process and to obtain your electronic signature (which will be very useful 
              later) and to convert the company's temporary bank account into a permanent one.
            </p>
            <p><img src='./assets/images/icon_leaf.png' class='leavesCompany' alt='leaf icon'/>  Once the company formation 
              is complete, we present the stamps to our client. If desired, we also help in finding reliable accountants 
              and staff. Additionally, for clients who do not have a clear plan for operations or investment, we can 
              assist with business planning, ideas, and licensing.
