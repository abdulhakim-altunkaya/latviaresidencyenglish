              Once your residency-by-investment application is approved, you will be issued 
              temporary residence permits for the first five years. These permits can 
              sometimes be granted for one year at a time or for longer. At the end of 
              the fifth year, if your investment is still maintained as it was, you can 
              then apply for permanent residence. To be eligible for permanent residence,
               you must have spent at least 4 years in Latvia with temporary residence. 
               Otherwise, you would receive another temporary residence permit.

            To apply for citizenship, you must first hold temporary residence for 5 years, 
            and then obtain permanent residence at the end of the fifth year. In your 10th 
            year in Latvia, you can apply for citizenship. You also need to have knowledge 
            of Latvian history, language, and general culture.

            Yes, if you have A2-level Latvian language skills and have spent 4 out 
            of those 5 years in Latvia under your residence permit, you can obtain permanent 
            residence. Otherwise, you will simply renew your temporary residence permit.

            It is not mandatory. If you do not meet the conditions for permanent residence, 
            you can simply apply again for a temporary residence permit. To do this, you must 
            have maintained your investment in its original form. After five years, there is 
            an application fee of 5,000 Euros for another temporary residence card. You must 
            submit your application before your current residence card expires or within 40 
            days after it expires. If you miss this window, you would have to reapply from 
            the beginning and pay all fees again. As long as you maintain your investment, 
            you can always obtain a temporary residence card. Temporary residence cards 
            do not require knowledge of Latvian or continuous residence in Latvia.

            No. If you want to work in another EU country under a long-term residence permit, 
            you must meet additional requirements set by that country. These requirements
